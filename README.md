# Solids_deadops_first_person_script

#First person for Dead Ops Arcade install
Open %%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t5\scripts\sp

next take the `zombietron` folder and add it there along with the script inside
if you cannot download the `zombietron` folder, right click and make a new folder and name it `zombietron` then add the script to it
now open pluto t5, and launch dead ops in solo or private match (I have not tested multiplayer gameplay)
